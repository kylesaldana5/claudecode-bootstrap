### 1. Goals and Background Context

- **Project Name:** AI Blog Post Generator
- **Problem Statement:** Small businesses often struggle with creating and posting blog content to their websites efficiently, without compromising brand voice or content quality, despite recognizing the benefits of SEO. The current process can be time-consuming and manual, diverting focus from core business operations.
- **Proposed Solution:** This web app will leverage AI to significantly speed up the blog post creation process. It will maintain high quality and ensure content aligns with the client's unique brand voice by automating content generation and the publication workflow, thereby removing manual overhead for the service provider.
- **Target Audience:** My existing customers, primarily small businesses across various sectors like lawn care, construction, health businesses, and cleaning services. These clients are typically busy and lack the time to write blogs but desire the SEO benefits they provide. The direct user of this app is the service provider (you), who will manage content generation for these clients.
- **Business Goals:** To enhance my current website development offering by integrating this compelling AI-powered blog generation app/feature, thereby providing added value to clients and making the content creation process seamless and more attractive as a service.
- **Existing Landscape/Constraints:** The solution must integrate seamlessly with the existing client website stack, which includes Astro for the frontend, Netlify for hosting, Decap CMS for content management, and GitHub for code and content version control.
- **Success Metrics:** The primary success metric for this product's initial phase is its functional completion and operability as per the defined requirements. Once the app is fully functioning and working as intended, its value proposition will be leveraged in the service offering.
- **Assumptions & Constraints:** No specific external assumptions or hard constraints (e.g., budget, strict deadlines) are identified at this time beyond the existing tech stack.
- **Out of Scope:** For this initial version, all functionalities discussed during the brainstorming session (AI blog generation, personalization, Astro/Decap CMS integration, GitHub PR creation for content and images, and cost-effectiveness considerations) are considered **in scope**. The direct management of client profiles and GitHub repository associations by the service provider _within this app_ is out of scope.

### 2. Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)

This section details what the system _must do_ (functional) and what qualities the system _must have_ (non-functional).

#### 2.1 Functional Requirements (What the system must do)

- **Service Provider Authentication:**
  - As a service provider, I can securely log into the AI Blog Post Generator app.
- **Client Context & Configuration Utilization:**
  - As a system, upon service provider login, the app automatically identifies and applies the associated client's pre-configured brand voice, tone, industry/niche, and other relevant settings.
  - As a system, the app automatically knows which GitHub repository corresponds to the identified client's website.
- **Blog Post Generation:**
  - As a service provider, I can initiate a new blog post generation request for the currently active client context.
  - As a service provider, I can provide a topic or general idea for the blog post.
  - As a service provider, I can input specific keywords for SEO optimization to guide AI content generation.

  - As a system, the app automatically formats the blog post content as a Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) file.
  - As a system, the app automatically generates the correct front matter (title, description, tags, permalink) within the Markdown/MDX file.
  - As a system, the app integrates with the GitHub API to:
    - Create a new branch for each new blog post.
    - Commit the generated Markdown/MDX file to `/src/content/blog/` in the new branch.
    - Commit associated images to `src/assets/images/blog/`.
    - Create a Pull Request (PR) from this new branch to the client's designated main branch (e.g., `main` or `production`).

#### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements (Qualities the system must have)

- **Performance:**
  - AI blog post generation should complete within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 1-2 minutes).
  - The service provider's user interface should be responsive and load quickly.
- **Security:**
  - Secure handling of GitHub API tokens/credentials and AI model API keys.
  - Secure storage of pre-configured client brand configurations and repository mappings.
  - Secure authentication mechanism for the service provider's access to the app.
- **Usability:**
  - The interface should be highly intuitive, straightforward, and easy to navigate for the service provider, minimizing cognitive load.
  - The workflow for content generation, editing, and publishing should be highly efficient, saving the service provider significant time.
  - **Feedback and Status:** Provide clear and concise feedback to the service provider regarding the publication status of a post (success or error).
- **Maintainability:**
  - The codebase should be well-structured, modular, and easy to understand for future updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:**
  - The system should be designed to optimize AI API usage (e.g., token management, prompt efficiency) to keep operational costs low for the service provider.
  - Leverage serverless architectures to minimize infrastructure costs.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement robust testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) to mitigate common issues such as irrelevant AI-generated content before deployment.
  - In the event of an unhandled backend failure (e.g., GitHub API failure during publication), the system should:
    - Send an email notification to the service provider (you).
    - Display a clear alert to the service provider on the frontend of the app indicating that something went wrong and to try again later.
- **Scalability:** The initial version is expected to support the discussed functionalities effectively. Future scalability for a higher volume of posts or clients will be addressed as needed.
- **Accessibility:** No specific accessibility compliance requirements (e.g., WCAG) are mandated for this initial version.

### 3. User Interface Design Goals

This section describes the high-level vision for the user experience and design of the web app from the service provider's perspective. It focuses on the overall feel and approach, rather than specific layouts.

- **Simplicity and Clarity:** The interface must be extremely straightforward and easy for the service provider to navigate, minimizing complexity, especially concerning backend processes like GitHub integration.
- **Efficiency:** The UI should be designed to streamline the content generation, editing, and deployment workflow, saving the service provider significant time.
- **Brand Consistency:** The app's UI should reflect a clean, minimalist, and professional aesthetic that aligns with your service's brand.
- **Feedback and Status:** Provide clear and immediate feedback to the service provider _only_ on the success or failure of the blog post publication action.
- **User Persona Alignment:** The UI will prioritize a straightforward and simple experience, assuming the service provider logs in and immediately focuses on content creation and publishing, without needing to manage client configurations or repository links within the app. The AI's content generation quality is expected to handle the "heavy lifting" of varied content needs.

### 4. Technical Assumptions

This section outlines the key technical choices, platforms, and architectural considerations for the web app, ensuring alignment with the simplified service provider experience.

- **Frontend Framework (for the AI Blog Post Generator App UI):** Astro
- **Content Management System (for client websites):** Decap CMS
- **Hosting (for the AI Blog Post Generator App):** Netlify
- **Version Control:** GitHub (for client repositories and the app's own codebase)
- **Backend/API Layer:**
  - **AI Integration:** Utilize a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) API for content generation (e.g., Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT).
  - **GitHub Integration:** Use GitHub API for repository interactions (branching, committing, PR creation).
  - **Serverless Functions:** This is the likely approach for backend logic to handle AI and GitHub API calls (e.g., Netlify Functions, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to ensure cost-effectiveness and scalability.
  - **Client Context Handling:** The serverless functions will be responsible for implicitly linking the logged-in service provider to their specific client's pre-configured brand settings and GitHub repository details.
- **Database/Data Storage:**
  - A database or persistent storage solution (e.g., NoSQL database, or even managed JSON files/key-value store for simplicity if feasible) will be required for storing pre-configured client profiles, brand configurations, and potentially generated post drafts/history. _This data is managed outside the service provider's interaction with the app._
- **Authentication:**
  - A secure authentication mechanism will be implemented for the service provider's login.
- **API Keys/Credentials Management:**
  - For maximum security, API keys for AI models (e.g., Google's Gemini, OpenAI) and GitHub should be stored as **environment variables** within the Netlify build environment for serverless functions. For highly sensitive or frequently rotated keys, consider a dedicated secret management service if needed in the future.
- **Version Control Strategy (for the app itself):**
  - The AI Blog Post Generator app's codebase will reside in its own GitHub repository. The **GitHub Flow** branching strategy is recommended for its simplicity and efficiency, involving a `main` branch and feature branches for new development, with pull requests for review.
- **Deployment Strategy (for the app itself):**
  - Continuous Deployment (CD) from GitHub via Netlify will be implemented. Merges to the `main` branch will automatically trigger new builds and deployments to Netlify.
- **Testing Strategy:**
  - A comprehensive testing strategy will be adopted, including:
    - **Unit Tests:** To verify individual functions and components.
    - **Integration Tests:** To ensure different parts of the system (e.g., AI integration, GitHub API calls) work correctly together.
    - **End-to-End Tests:** To simulate the service provider's workflow and ensure the entire application functions as expected.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Implement robust logging within serverless functions to capture operational data and errors.
  - Utilize Netlify's built-in analytics and logging tools, and potentially integrate with external monitoring services (e.g., Sentry for error tracking, DataDog for performance monitoring) as the application grows.
