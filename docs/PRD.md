### 1. Goals and Background Context

- **Project Name:** Personal To-Do List App
- **Problem Statement:** Many individuals struggle with organizing their daily tasks, tracking priorities, and maintaining productivity. Existing solutions are often too complex, lack essential features, or don't integrate well with users' workflows.
- **Proposed Solution:** A clean, intuitive web-based to-do list application that allows users to create, organize, and track their tasks with priority levels, due dates, and categories. The app will focus on simplicity while providing powerful features for personal productivity.
- **Target Audience:** Busy professionals, students, and individuals who need a reliable system to manage their personal tasks and stay organized. Users range from tech-savvy professionals to casual users who want a simple task management solution.
- **Business Goals:** To create a user-friendly productivity tool that helps users organize their tasks effectively, with potential for future monetization through premium features and integrations.
- **Existing Landscape/Constraints:** The solution should work across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and integrate with common productivity tools. Initial version will focus on web-based functionality with responsive design.
- **Success Metrics:** User engagement (daily active users), task completion rates, user retention, and user satisfaction scores. Success will be measured by users consistently using the app to manage their daily tasks.
- **Assumptions & Constraints:** Users have basic internet connectivity and use modern web browsers. No specific budget constraints for the initial version.
- **Out of Scope:** For this initial version, team collaboration features, advanced reporting, and third-party integrations (calendar sync, email notifications) are considered out of scope. Focus is on core individual task management functionality.

### 3. User Interface Design Goals

This section describes the high-level vision for the user experience and design of the to-do list app. It focuses on the overall feel and approach, rather than specific layouts.

- **Simplicity and Clarity:** The interface should be clean and uncluttered, allowing users to focus on their tasks without distractions. Clear visual hierarchy with easy-to-understand icons and labels.
- **Efficiency:** The UI should minimize the number of clicks and steps required to complete common actions like adding, editing, or marking tasks as complete.
- **Visual Design:** Modern, clean aesthetic with consistent color scheme and typography. Use of white space to avoid overwhelming users with information.
- **Feedback and Status:** Provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions - task completion animations, loading states, success/error messages.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Design with mobile usage in mind, ensuring the app works seamlessly across all device sizes while maintaining full functionality.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the interface is accessible to users with disabilities through proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

### 4. Technical Assumptions

This section outlines the key technical choices, platforms, and architectural considerations for the to-do list web app.

- **Frontend Framework:** React or Vue.js for building the user interface
- **Styling:** CSS-in-JS (styled-components) or Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Hosting:** Netlify or Vercel for frontend deployment
- **Version Control:** GitHub for codebase management
- **Backend/API Layer:**
  - **RESTful API:** Design RESTful endpoints for task operations (CRUD)
  - **Serverless Functions:** Use serverless functions (Netlify Functions, Vercel Functions, or AWS Lambda) for API endpoints to ensure cost-effectiveness and scalability
  - **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions
- **Database/Data Storage:**
  - **NoSQL Database:** MongoDB or Firebase Firestore for flexible task data storage
  - **Alternative:** PostgreSQL with a simple relational schema for structured data
