### 1. High-Level Architecture Overview

The system consists of a modern web application frontend, a serverless backend handling core business logic, and a database for data persistence. The architecture follows modern web development patterns for scalability and maintainability.

- **User Interface (Frontend):** The web interface users will interact with to manage their tasks. Built using React or Vue.js and hosted on Netlify/Vercel. Provides an intuitive, responsive experience for task management across devices.
- **Serverless Backend (API Layer):** The core application logic handling user authentication, task operations, and data management. Implemented using serverless functions (Netlify Functions, Vercel Functions, or AWS Lambda) in **Node.js**.
- **Database:** Persistent storage for user accounts and task data using either MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (relational), depending on data complexity needs.
- **Authentication Service:** Secure user authentication system using JWT tokens for session management.
- **External Services:**
  - **Email Service:** For password reset and account verification (optional).
  - **Monitoring Service:** Error tracking and performance monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket).
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Frontend hosted on Netlify/Vercel with continuous deployment from GitHub.

### 3. Data Flow and Interactions

This section describes the sequence of operations and data exchange between the different components of the system for key user flows.

#### 3.1 User Registration Flow

1. **User (Frontend):** Fills out registration form with email, password, and optional profile information.
2. **Frontend -> Authentication API:** Sends registration request to serverless function.
3. **Authentication API -> Database:** Validates email uniqueness and stores user data with hashed password.
4. **Database -> Authentication API:** Confirms user creation and returns user ID.
5. **Authentication API -> Frontend:** Returns success response with JWT token.
6. **Frontend:** Stores JWT token securely and redirects user to task dashboard.

#### 3.2 User Login Flow

1. **User (Frontend):** Enters login credentials (email/password) into the login form.
2. **Frontend -> Authentication API:** Sends login request to serverless authentication function.
3. **Authentication API -> Database:** Verifies credentials against stored user data.
4. **Database -> Authentication API:** Returns authentication result and user information.
5. **Authentication API -> Frontend:** Returns JWT token upon successful authentication.
6. **Frontend:** Stores the token securely (httpOnly cookie or secure localStorage) for subsequent authenticated requests.

#### 3.3 Task Creation Flow

1. **User (Frontend):** Fills out task creation form with title, description, priority, due date, and category.
2. **Frontend -> Task API:** Sends task creation request with user authentication token.
3. **Task API:** Validates user authentication and task data.
4. **Task API -> Database:** Creates new task record associated with user ID.

### 4. Key Technical Considerations

This section addresses important architectural decisions, design patterns, and cross-cutting concerns that will influence the development and operational aspects of the system.

#### 4.1 Authentication and Authorization Strategy

- **User Authentication:**
  - **Method:** JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing (bcrypt) and email verification.
  - **Flow:** Upon successful login, a JWT token is issued and stored securely in the frontend. This token is sent with all subsequent API requests for authentication.
  - **Security:** Implement token expiration, refresh token strategy, and secure token storage practices.
- **Authorization:**
  - **Method:** User-based access control ensuring users can only access their own task data.
  - **Enforcement:** Serverless functions validate JWT tokens and check user ownership of resources before allowing operations.
- **Alternative:** Consider third-party authentication services (Auth0, Firebase Auth) for additional security features and OAuth integration.

#### 4.2 Database Design

- **Schema (MongoDB Example):**
  - **`users` collection:** Stores user credentials, email, name, profile settings, and account metadata.
  - **`tasks` collection:** Stores task data including title, description, priority, due_date, category, status, user_id (foreign key), created_at, updated_at.
- **Schema (PostgreSQL Example):**
  - **`users` table:** Primary key, email (unique), password_hash, name, created_at, updated_at.
  - **`tasks` table:** Primary key, user_id (foreign key), title, description, priority, due_date, category, status, created_at, updated_at.
- **Data Access Patterns:** Implement efficient queries for task filtering, sorting, and searching with proper indexing.

#### 4.3 Security and Secret Management

- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive credentials (database connection strings, JWT secrets, API keys) as environment variables in the hosting platform.
- **Data Security:** Implement HTTPS for all communications, secure password hashing, and input sanitization.
- **CORS Configuration:** Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against DoS attacks.

#### 4.4 Error Handling and Observability

- **Frontend Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages with clear guidance for resolution.
- **Backend Error Handling:**
  - Implement comprehensive `try-catch` blocks for all API operations.
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
  - Log detailed error information for debugging while avoiding sensitive data exposure.
- **Monitoring:** Integrate error tracking (Sentry) and performance monitoring tools.
- **Logging:** Implement structured logging for both frontend and backend operations.

#### 4.5 Performance Optimizations

- **Database Optimization:**
  - Implement proper indexing for task queries (user_id, created_at, due_date, priority).
  - Use database connection pooling for efficient resource usage.
  - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
- **Frontend Performance:**
  - Implement lazy loading for task lists and components.
  - Use virtual scrolling for large task lists.
  - Optimize bundle size with code splitting and tree shaking.
- **API Performance:** Implement pagination for task lists and optimize query performance.

#### 4.6 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **Version Control:** Use GitHub Flow with feature branches and pull requests for code review.
- **Automated Testing:** Implement CI pipeline with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Automated deployment to staging and production environments on merge to main branch.
- **Environment Management:** Separate staging and production environments with appropriate configurations.
