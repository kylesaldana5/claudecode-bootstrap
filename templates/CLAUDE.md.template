## MCP Integrations

This project is configured with two MCP servers for enhanced AI capabilities:

- **Serena IDE Assistant:** Intelligent code completion, analysis, and project-aware development assistance
- **Context7 Documentation:** Access to comprehensive library documentation and smart library resolution

Both MCP servers are automatically configured in `.mcp.json`. Serena requires `uvx` package manager, while Context7 requires Node.js ≥ v18.0.0.

## Best Practices

- Always run bootstrap command after updating PRD or Technical Architecture
- Use work command for systematic issue implementation
- Run review command on all PRs before merging
- Keep CLAUDE.md updated with project evolution
- Document any project-specific conventions or requirements below
