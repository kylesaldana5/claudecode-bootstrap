# ClaudeCode Bootstrap

A GitHub template repository for rapidly bootstrapping new development projects with Claude Code || Curosr integration, automated workflows, and comprehensive development tooling.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Use This Template
Click the **"Use this template"** button above to create a new repository from this template.

### 2. Clone and Initialize
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-new-project.git
cd your-new-project
run claude to init 
```

### 3. Generate Your Documentation
This repository includes comprehensive example documents that you can use as templates:

- **`docs/PRD.md`** - Complete Product Requirements Document (using a to-do app example)
- **`docs/TechnicalArchitecture.md`** - Detailed Technical Architecture Document (using a to-do app example)

**Need help generating in-depth PRDs and technical architecture?** Use this repository as a reference! The included documents demonstrate best practices for:
- Requirements gathering and specification
- Technical system design and architecture
- Component breakdown and data flow
- Security and performance considerations
- Development workflow planning

#### 💡 My Personal Workflow for Document Generation
For generating comprehensive PRDs and technical documentation, I personally use the [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD). This systematic approach helps create thorough, professional documentation through AI-assisted development workflows.

**Quick setup:**
The BMAD Method provides specialized agents (`/pm`, `/architect`, `/analyst`) that work together to create detailed project documentation, which I then use as the foundation for projects in this template.

Simply copy the structure from the example documents and adapt the content for your specific project needs.

### 4. Start Development
```bash
# Create GitHub issues from your PRD
/bootstrap

# Implement features systematically
/work

# Review pull requests thoroughly
/review
```

### 4. To use Cursor instead of Cluade Code
Still follow step one from above to generate all github issues from your PRD
```bash
# Create GitHub issues from your PRD
/bootstrap
```

## 🔧 Detailed Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional, for enhanced GitHub integration)
- Git configured with your credentials

### Kickstart Script
The `./kickstart "Project Name"` script automatically:
- ✅ Replaces template placeholders with your project details
- ✅ Initializes Claude Code with proper configuration
- ✅ Creates documentation directory structure
- ✅ Provides clear next steps for development

### MCP Integration Setup
The template includes two MCP servers for enhanced development capabilities:

1. **Serena IDE Assistant** (auto-configured)
   - Intelligent code completion and analysis
   - Project-aware development assistance
   - Requires `uvx` package manager (install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
   - No additional API keys required

2. **Context7 Documentation** (auto-configured)
   - Access to comprehensive library documentation
   - Smart library ID resolution
   - Requires Node.js ≥ v18.0.0
   - No additional API keys required

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- Create comprehensive PRD with epics and requirements
- Design technical architecture with component breakdown
- Place both documents in `docs/` directory

### 2. Issue Generation
```bash
/bootstrap
```
- Automatically converts PRD into structured GitHub issues
- Maps requirements to implementation tasks
- Creates proper issue labels and milestones

### 3. Feature Implementation
```bash
/work
```
- Systematic issue implementation
- Automated Git workflow (branch → commit → PR)
- Consistent code quality and documentation

### 4. Code Review
```bash
/review
```
- Comprehensive PR analysis
- Security and performance review
- Automated feedback and suggestions

### 5. Iteration
Repeat the work/review cycle for continuous development.

## 📖 Command Reference

### Core Commands
- `./kickstart "Project Name"` - Initialize new project from template
- `/bootstrap` - Generate GitHub issues from PRD
- `/work` - Implement features systematically
- `/review` - Review pull requests
- `/issues` - Create individual issues

### File Structure Commands
After running kickstart, your project will have:
- Clear documentation structure in `docs/`
- Automated development workflows in `.claude/commands/`
- GitHub templates and CI/CD in `.github/`
- MCP configurations for enhanced AI capabilities

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding Custom Commands
Create new `.md` files in `.claude/commands/` following this pattern:
```markdown
# Command Name

Your Claude Code prompt here...

## Context
- Describe what this command does
- List any prerequisites
- Explain expected outcomes
```

### Modifying MCP Configurations
Edit `.mcp.json` to add or modify MCP servers. Current configuration includes:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena", "serena-mcp-server", "--context", "ide-assistant", "--project", "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tech Stack Templates
The template is framework-agnostic. Add tech-stack-specific configurations as needed:
- Package managers (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build tools and configurations
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment configurations

## 🚀 Why Use This Template?

### Before ClaudeCode Bootstrap
- ❌ Manual Claude Code setup for each project
- ❌ Repetitive MCP configuration
- ❌ Inconsistent development workflows
- ❌ Time-consuming GitHub issue creation
- ❌ Ad-hoc project structure

### After ClaudeCode Bootstrap
- ✅ **One-command setup** → Fully configured project ready for development
- ✅ **Automated workflows** → Consistent development processes
- ✅ **AI-enhanced development** → Leverage Claude Code's full capabilities
- ✅ **Rapid prototyping** → From idea to implementation faster
- ✅ **Scalable structure** → Organized foundation that grows with your project

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Rapid Prototyping** - Get from idea to working prototype faster
- **Client Projects** - Professional setup with consistent workflows
- **Team Development** - Standardized processes and structure
- **Learning Projects** - Best practices built-in from day one
- **Production Applications** - Scalable foundation with proper tooling
- **Documentation Templates** - Use example PRDs and architecture docs as starting points for any project
