# Review Command - Automated Pull Request Review

## Overview

**You are an AI assistant tasked with conducting a comprehensive code review of a GitHub pull request. Your goal is to analyze all changes, provide detailed feedback, and submit a formal review with actionable recommendations.**

## Input Format

The command will be called with a pull request number:

```
/review 123
```

## Process Steps

Follow these steps to complete the pull request review:

### 1. Fetch pull request details:

- Use `gh pr view {pr_number}` to read the complete PR details
- Parse PR title, description, linked issues, and file changes
- Understand the scope and purpose of the changes
- Note the feature branch and target branch information

### 2. Analyze the code changes:

- Use `gh pr diff {pr_number}` to view all code changes
- Review each modified file for:
  - Code quality and adherence to project standards
  - Logic correctness and potential bugs
  - Security considerations and vulnerabilities
  - Performance implications
  - Documentation and comment quality
  - Test coverage adequacy

### 3. Validate implementation requirements:

- Compare changes against linked issue requirements
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Check for completeness of implementation
- Ensure no scope creep or missing functionality
- Validate architectural consistency with project patterns

### 4. Check technical standards:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Type safety, modern syntax, error handling
- **Astro Components**: Component structure, props validation, slot usage
- **CSS/Styling**: Consistency with design system, responsive design
- **File Organization**: Proper directory structure, naming conventions
- **Import/Export**: Clean import paths, proper module exports

### 5. Assess quality factors:

- **Maintainability**: Clear code structure, readable logic
- **Reusability**: Component design, utility function patterns
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities, bundle size impact
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
- **SEO**: Meta tags, structured data, content optimization

### 6. Submit comprehensive review:

- Use `gh pr review {pr_number} --comment` to submit formal review
- Include specific line comments for individual issues
- Provide overall summary with recommendations
- Always use COMMENT mode to avoid approval conflicts

- Code quality meets or exceeds standards
- No significant issues or concerns
- Ready for merge

### **Status: REQUEST_CHANGES** ‚ùå

- Critical bugs or security issues
- Requirements not fully met
- Significant code quality concerns
- Breaking changes to existing functionality

### **Status: COMMENT** üí¨

- Minor suggestions for improvement
- Questions about implementation choices
- Non-blocking feedback
- General observations and recommendations

## GitHub CLI Commands

```bash
# View pull request details
gh pr view {pr_number}

# View code changes
gh pr diff {pr_number}

# Review specific files
gh pr diff {pr_number} --name-only
gh pr diff {pr_number} src/components/

# Submit comment-only review (default approach)
gh pr review {pr_number} --comment --body "Review summary..."

# Note: --approve and --request-changes options removed to avoid conflicts
# All reviews use --comment mode with status indicated in the review body
```

## Success Criteria

The review command is successful when:

- [ ] PR details and changes thoroughly analyzed
- [ ] All code quality aspects evaluated
- [ ] Implementation completeness verified
- [ ] Technical standards compliance checked
- [ ] Comprehensive review submitted to GitHub
- [ ] Actionable feedback provided for any issues
- [ ] Review decision clearly justified

## Command Usage

```
